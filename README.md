SearchMode searchMode = SearchMode.RELEVANCE; // see "SearchMode.java" for other search modes

// search games
Games games = steam.searchGame(gameTitle, upperLimit, searchMode);
games.printAll();

// retrieve extra info about a game
Game game = games.get(0);
String gameId = game.getId();
GameExtra gameExtra = steam.retrieveExtraInfo(gameId);
System.out.print(gameExtra);
