## SteamAPI - {under development}

A Java library to search and retrieve game info from [*Steam*](http://store.steampowered.com/), the online gaming platform

**How to use:**
```java
SteamAPI steam = new SteamAPI(CountryCode.US);

String gameTitle = "depth";
int numOfResults = 5; // upper limit for the number of games to be retrieved
SearchMode searchMode = SearchMode.RELEVANCE; // see "SearchMode.java" for other search modes

// search the Steam game store
Games games = steam.searchStore(gameTitle, numOfResults, searchMode);
games.printAll();

// retrieve extra info about a game
Game game = games.get(0);
String gameId = game.getId();
GameExtra gameExtra = steam.retrieveExtraInfo(gameId);
System.out.print(gameExtra);
```
